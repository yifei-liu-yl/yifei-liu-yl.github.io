I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural & Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

<p>
My research interests are in energy and environmental economics, empirical industrial organization, and applied econometrics. 
</p>

<p>
My current work examines challenges in energy infrastructure development, with a focus on the electricity grid connection interconnection process, infrastructure permitting, and transmission planning in the United States. I study how policy, regulatory structure, and market design shape investment decisions in the energy sector.

Prior to my doctoral study, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree from University of California-Berkeley.

I will be on the job market in the 2025-2026 academic year.
