Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural & Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include energy and environmental economics, and industrial organization.

<p>
My current work studies challenges related to the energy transition, focusing on transmission investment, the interconnection process, and the infrastructure permitting process in the United States.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in Environmental Science and Environmental Economics & Policy from UC Berkeley.
