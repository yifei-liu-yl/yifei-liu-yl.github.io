<p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://aae.wisc.edu/">Agricultural & Applied Economics</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>.  
</p>

<p>
I am an applied economist interested in environmental and energy economics as well as empirical industrial organization. 
</p>

<p>
I study how policy, regulatory institutions, and market structure shape investment in the energy sector. My current work examines challenges in energy infrastructure development, focusing on infrastructure permitting, electricity grid interconnection, and transmission planning in the United States, and their implications for environmental sustainability.
</p>

<p>
Prior to my doctoral study, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree from <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California–Berkeley</a>.

  <em><strong>I will be on the 2025–26 academic job market.<strong></em>
