Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural & Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include energy and environmental economics, and industrial organization. My current work studies challenges related to the energy transition, focusing on transmission investment, the interconnection process, and the infrastructure permitting process in the United States.
