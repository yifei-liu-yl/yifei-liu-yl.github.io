    My responsibilities included teaching four weekly discussion sections with over 80 students total, guiding them in applying economic reasoning to global health challenges, environmental threats, and policy solutions. I graded assignments and final exams with detailed feedback to support student learning, and held two office hours weekly to address student questions and reinforce core concepts linking economic decision-making, planetary health, and policy evaluation.
