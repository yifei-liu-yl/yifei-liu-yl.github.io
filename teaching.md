    Sustaining global health and well-being depends critically on interactions between human and natural systems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Economics provides a useful paradigm for understanding these interactions and the pathways through which individual and societal decisions made in the face of scarce resources, and threats to the natural environment, generate health and well-being outcomes. Provides students with an opportunity to use basic economic and social science reasoning to describe global heath challenges; understand the causes and consequences of health discrepancies; evaluate health and environmental policies; and appreciate the interconnectedness of planetary health and economic outcomes.
