    <summary>Data Details</summary>
    This website provides historical data on energy projects seeking to connect to the electrical grid. When developers want to add new power generation to the grid, they must join an "interconnection queue" and undergo technical reviews to ensure grid compatibility. We extract data from these engineering studies to track project proposals and outcomes. Our first release covers the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM), which manages the power grid serving 65 million people across parts of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southern United States. These data include all connection requests submitted to PJM from 2008-2020.
