    <summary>Data Details</summary>
    This website makes public historical data on the interconnection queue. We extract these data from engineering studies issued as part of the interconnection process. Our first release is data for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM), a regional transmission operator (RTO) serving the Mid-Atlantic region. These data cover all requests for interconnection made to PJM from 2008-2020.
